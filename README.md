cs56-misc-map-gui

if it is possible to merge this project with https://github.com/UCSB-CS56-Projects/cs56-calculatewalkingtime/blob/master/html/index.html
I could see it as a good way ot take this project. Alternatively it could be better if you could even look at two buildings at once ie youare here, you need to get there autohighlighting. but this might be difficult...

W16 Final Remarks
We added information buttons under every buildings. We added a welcome page. We adjust the buttons in the main page and made the window size static. We added a command line version of this interactive map. we dealed with some duplicated code and put actionlistener codes in a helper function. the bug is in the command line version when you press cancel.You can rearrange the place of the buttons.
